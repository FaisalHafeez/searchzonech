Test

> A configurable, generic search UI for
> any [Elastic App Search](https://www.elastic.co/products/app-search) Engine.

## Getting started 🐣

```bash
# Run this to set everything up
npm install

# Run this to start your application and open it up in a new browser window
npm start
```

## Usage

### Updating configuration

The project can be configured via a JSON [config file](src/config/engine.json).

You can easily control things like...

- The Engine the UI runs against
- Which fields are displayed
- The filters that are used

If you would like to make configuration changes, there is no need to regenerate
this app from your App Search Dashboard!

You can simply open up the
[engine.json](src/config/engine.json) file, update the [options](#config),
and then restart this app.
